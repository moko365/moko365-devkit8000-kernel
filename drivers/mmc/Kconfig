config AZWAVE_HACK_FOR_GH600_ON_BEAGLEBOARD
	bool "MMC hack for GH600 on beagleboard"
	depends on MMC
	help 
	  Theis is a dirty hack for GH600 on beagleboard. 
	  Because of GH600 does not work with HS SDIO, and therefore slow down the speed of SDIO clock rate. 
	  Also remove some error check on drivers/mmc/core/sdio_cis.c so that we can initial GH600
	  It's a DIRTY hack and need to be fixed in the feature. (with HW?)
